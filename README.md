# instagram-clone
Developing a clone of Instagram using React Native requires putting up a phone application with the same features and layout as Instagram. Usually, this project entails user authentication, a feed that shows posts of people being followed, photo or video sharing, liking and commenting on pictures and lastly user profiles. Utilizing React Native ensures that our Instagram clone application is available to use on different devices without any limitation. Developers can swiftly imitate Instagram's user experience and functions by using libraries such as React Navigation for navigation, Redux for state management, and Firebase for backend services.
